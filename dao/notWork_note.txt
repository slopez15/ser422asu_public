I could not find a root path or http method in any java files.
I don't know if dao files are runnable.
web.xml
	refer to notes
	compiled files under web-inf(web-inf/classes/files), 
	web.xml (/web-inf) in dataServlet example called class files but never had /classes dir name.
ClueGame_HttpSession showed the use of static files leading into the java files.(also, http methods WERE used, unlike dao.)

================
404.
If war unpacked and not appear, may be on other tomcat.

focus on jar/war file.
	4xx means client ~=war complete, but maybe main method resource not found, 
	5xx means server ~=java crash, war incomplete, etc.
see servlet slides for other info if needed.

gradle assemble && gradle classes && gradle jar

Most edits are in build.xml and build.properties.
build.properties --
	change tomcat.home to correct path.
		single tomcat
			include the port for full folder path.
		tomcat8 -> tomcat8
			probably has 2 tomcats in mind
		tomcat7 -> tomcat8-8080
			since tomcat 7 was old and
			pribably has 1 tomcat in mind
		tomcat8-8080 -> tomcat-8080
			probably has 1 tomcat in mind
		*When building my 2 tomcats refer to ___ for 2 tomcat build.xml structure.
		may need certain properties for clean,cleanall in 
build.xml--submit.jar & javadoc
		*may need to edit asurite.id
build.xml --
	may need to mkdir a lib folder.
	javadoc may need a file set to src.
	*may need to include a library. like javax
	*MongoExamples -- needs certain files.
	*some cleaning targets need to be updated.
	*may need to update clean & cleanall, submit, and javadoc. 
		you may need to edit build.properties
	javadoc 
		base on ClueGame
   		  I will go without adding those targets if they don't have one.
		  cleanall will try deleting if exists though.
		If ever adding, check these...
		use booktown as example
		  mkdir in init
		  depend in submit. Alse, update includes attribute.
All the applications that probably need a clean target update.

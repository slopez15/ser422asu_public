Building: can use ant build to zip for submission of both task1&2, etc.
need2zip both war(w/o *.java) files(task1&2), and 2 src 
trees(notNwar)(no classes/bin/war)(yes *.java,staticFiles).
ant (compile,build,dist,clean.deploy)(use existing to make it easy)
could refer to 
	stateExample & servlets\examples(maybe a build problem)
	servlets\examples can look for original example in "Servlets and JSPs"

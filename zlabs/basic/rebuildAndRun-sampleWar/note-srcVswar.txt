kgary not want src (*.java) in war. 
static files should all be in src
src wo/compiled files (classes/bin)

This means I cannot rebuild sample.war w/kgary limitations.
Will give war file as his build scripts work and src tree
THEN, README to tell where should place src tree 
	to be like the war un-packing.(like sample.war)
